Steps to Run a Streamlit App:
1. Ensure Python is Installed

Make sure Python (preferably version 3.7 or higher) is installed on your system.
Verify by running:
bash

python --version


2. Install Streamlit

Install Streamlit using pip:
bash

pip install streamlit


3. Install Required Modules

If your app uses additional modules like openai, install them using pip:
bash

pip install openai


4. Create or Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with global Python packages:
bash

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac

venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

Then install the required modules inside the virtual environment.


5. Set OpenAI API Key

Replace "your_openai_api_key" in the code with your actual OpenAI API key or set it as an environment variable:
bash

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"  # On Linux/Mac

set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"    # On Windows


6. Run the Streamlit App
Navigate to the folder containing app.py and run:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py


7. Fix "ModuleNotFoundError"

If openai or any module is still not found:
Ensure the correct Python environment is active.

Install the missing module:
bash

pip install openai

Verify the installation:

bash

Copy code

pip show openai


8. Access the Streamlit App

After running the app, Streamlit will provide a URL (usually http://localhost:8501/) in the terminal.

Open this URL in a web browser to access the app.
